        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Cade Rubalcaba and I am currently a freshman at UCR. I have maintained a GPA above 3.5 in all 4 years of high school and have attainted principals and honor roll multiple times through high-school. I played a year of both freshman baseball and track and 3 years of varsity football. I live in a family of 4, in the community of chino, California. I was born in the United States and have attended public school here my entire life.<br><br>

         The primary skill I bring forward are the determination to strive towards a companyâ€™s goals. Another skill I provide is through my friendly demeanor and communication skills to work through daily problems. These skills allow me to commit to work and follow through on whatever the company requires me to do. I strive to go beyond the expectations of the company and set a new standard that can benefit the community in every way. I never want to settle and continue to keep moving forward until I ultimately achieve my goal. <br><br>

         I have a passion to climb over steep obstacles that keep me distanced away from my goals. Iâ€™ve dealt with numerous injuries including 2 broken noses and a broken jaw and this allowed me to manage high pain levels and have courage to go back to sports at 100%. Many times I have been encouraged to step away from the things I loved doing, but I have the fire within me to go on and pursue whatever I want to accomplish. I value my value my family and friends as they are my main supporters who encourage me to do my very best in whatever I do. I strive to one day to help my parents pay off their pills and return the favors that they had given me as they raised me. Everyday I feel I constant obligation to repay all my loved ones who contributed and supported me throughout all my challenges. This feeling reminds me everyday I am more than just one person, I am a collection of all the people who support me and myself. I desire to have my future family be well cared for and provide my children with as much support as I had growing up. 

In a company I value competition the most, I do because I want to be encouraged to strive to do my very best and have competition around me to push me even further than I can imagine. My current job title is aReal estate assistant to my parents. My job duties consist of office management as I print files for my parents needs, meet clients who need to be let in at open house, and maintain homes to look professional to clients. I have been in this position for the last 4 years and I am pursuing to obtain a Real estate license to work along side my parents and possibly gain the experience to start my own business. Please reach me at my personal email, caderubalcaba@gmail.com if you need to reach me.
